To Do
-------------------

= Doctrine / Eloquent / ORM =

I'm debating whether I should use one of these. It is mostly not necessary but
good to use going forward as I noticed a problem going from 5.3.x (at home) to
5.3.x (at server godaddy).


= Mail =

I need to make a nice looking email. It should include
my photo (check)
website info (check)
email info (check)
only email link to playlist (check)
    - DONE but it looks like p-r-u-p


= Song JSON Output =
(I do not want to do a callback so I have to abstract mp3info class)
Only show location data to admin
only show songs above 192 to non-admins
    - prolly have to look into IoC/dependency injection


= App Pages = 

settings (users) - mixlength, starting BPM, starting keycode, hashtag
signin (use OAuth 2)
loader 
     - serato crates
     - NI Traktor Folder
     - to the cloud 
     - I can use csv and file reader modules by the phpleague
playlists - doesn't work for long lists (noticed problems at 70 songs, but only on IE)
            - decided I'm ONLY going to email a link the list (check)
    - show spinner on reorder (check but doesn't appear to make a change)

myplaylist {playlist-name}
    - requires url-ready-name AND hashtag in database (check)
livelists - show songs selected at/for eventID or #hastag


search
    - show last selected songs (JS written and available)
    -   increase pagination button size (check)

    - show song tools (php written and JSON output ready)
    - get song images via Apple API and cache
        php written to get songs
    

export - show hashtag info -> requires a tableColumn (check)

playlist - show TimeElapsed per song - check
navig - change login to Admin - check

= HTML Pages = 

remake homepage with existing stuff which is enough
create a footer for homepage (check)
about page - check
social icons -> mixcloud, mixcrate, soundcloud (meh - too big for mobile)
home - add shadow to text (check)
search - tint cover image instead of row
footer - no bullets (check)

bio, about, REMOVE drinks, home finish (check)

= theme =

the night of your (their) life
tons of drinks (check)
packed dance floor
no more empty dance floors (check)
