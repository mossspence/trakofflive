my searchable serato/traktor library online


The purpose of this application is to make my library portable. I essentially will be creating a database and exporting it to the cloud so I can see it at anytime. I want to know what songs I have at any moment so I don't do something stupid like buy a music album for the third time because I'm so forgetful.

I'm in Canada so I don't have (proper) access to Google Play Music, I don't use iTunes and I needed a project to test out a bunch of stuff.

Stuff Tested
------------

HTML5 attributes local storage knockout.JS Silex ...

Important Stuff
---------------

I've used composer to install bunch of javascript libraries. Unfortunately I was using store.js instead of store2.js so I will have to fix that later.
